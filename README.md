Angular4J is a framework whose intention is to use JavaEE7 -and more precisely the CDI specification- with AngularJS. 
It was based on the AngularBeans project (https://bessemhmidi.github.io/AngularBeans/) but followed its a new way due to new security and performance requirements. 
Maintained by the company Teorema Sistemas (http://www.teorema.inf.br)  where it makes available its technical team in order to develop it and to apply in its own products.

With the help of the free software community, the Teorema Sistemas seeks to develop its tools, as well as helping other developers do the same.
